i. Interest of content - oustanding
  The content was informative, and contained information I did not previously know. It was the right length, long enough for me to gain an overview, but not too long as to overcomplicate the information.
  To improve I would maybe only include one page on medicine, and instead include an additional page on a different topic.


ii. Consistency and quality of visual presentation - excellent
  Homepage: All pictures of the team are the same size and formatting, though it would have been nice to actually have pictures of the team.

  Prediction and analysis: looks good in full screen mode, however when you resize the webpage the formatting is not good, e.g. you cannot read the introductory paragraph as it goes underneath the image, which has a white background.

  Modern Medicine: The page resizes well (ie formatting still works), however it contains no images and is very simplistic.

  Past medicine: Page looks fantastic, resizes well(ie formatting still works) and a wide use of different text styles.

  AI: Page resizes well (ie formatting still works), to improve maybe make the 'Image obtained  https://miappi.com.incorporating-ai-in-digital-marketing/' a small font size.

  Entire website: I like the navbar and footer. They're universal across all of the pages, and the use of a different colour makes the page more visually appealing. However, there is not a consistent layout and design across the 'information pages' (ie prediction and analysis, modern medicine, past medicine, AI) it would have been nice to see a more universal layout.


iii. Quality of written presentation - outstanding
  Grammar across the webpage is correct, you can understand what the author is trying to communicate. But as noted above you cannot read the entirety of the 'prediction and analysis' page when it is resized.


iv. Validity of HTML - very good
  homepage: line 34 unnecessary </a>
            line 59 '<a>' instead of </a>
            Generally indenting is good, and comments are sufficient. Though it would have been clearer if the authors had decided to either include the opening and closing tags on the same line or different lines and then made that consistent across the document. E.g. either <h1>title</h1> or
            <h1> title
            </h1>.

  Prediction and Analysis:   line 29 unnecessary </a>
                           line 77 unnecessary </article>
                           Generally indenting is good a couple more comments would have been appreciated. Above comment about opening and closing tags applies here as well.

  Modern Medicine:  line 24 unnecessary </a>
                  Navbar does not fully work. When navbar is expanded it works,  but on a smaller screen the drop down menu does not work. Generally, indenting is good. Comments are sufficient.
                  I think this page is written in HTML 4.

Past Medicine: line 27 unnecessary </a>
               Generally indenting is good, more comments would be appreciated.

AI: line 87 unnecessary </div>
    Indenting is generally good, though some comments are unnecessary.


v. Evidence of collaboration - outstanding

Author info: info not written by author.

Balanced contributions from members: some members appear to have contributed more, but those members have more experience, hence I would say the contributions appear to be quite balanced.

Not completed at the last minute: Some commits made this morning, however commits appear to have been made quite regularly over the weekend.
